1.  Introduction

   This document defines the BGP-4 [RFC4271] ADVISORY Message and
   Support for ADVISORY Message Capability to facilitate the exchange of
   human-oriented information specific to the BGP session through which
   the ADVISORY message is transmitted.  In concept this enhancement is
   similar to the dissemination of plan files [RFC1288], or write(1)
   [IEEE.1003.1] and not intended for real-time interactive
   communication.  ADVISORY messages are intended to aid root cause
   analysis and bootstrapping of out-of-band communication between
   operators by allowing them to signal key information over a known
   (and potentially trusted) in-band communication channel that is an
   existing BGP session.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   The BGP protocol extensions introduced in this document include the
   definition of a new BGP capability, named "Support for ADVISORY
   Message Capability", and the specification of the ADVISORY message.

2.1.  Support for ADVISORY Message Capability

   The "Support for ADVISORY Message Capability" is a new BGP capability
   [RFC5492].  The Length field of this capability MUST be set to 1.
   The Capability value MUST be set to the version of the ADVISORY
   message supported by the BGP speaker.  This document only defines
   ADVISORY version 1 messages.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker supports receiving ADVISORY messages,
   indicates what version of the ADVISORY message it supports, and
   supports the related procedures described in this document.

2.2.  ADVISORY Message

   An ADVISORY message is composed of an optional NOTICE, and optionally
   one or more ADVISE key-value pairs.  An ADVISORY message MUST NOT
   contain more than 16 ADVISE key-value pairs.  Each key and each value
   field MUST be preceded by a 1 octet Length field to indicate the
   length of the subsequent field.  ADVISE key fields have a REQUIRED
   maximum length of 32 octets.  ADVISE value fields have a REQUIRED
   maximum length of 128 octets.  To support international characters,
   all string fields MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  Fields are not NUL
   terminated.  There is no significance to the order of key-value
   pairs.

   A zero-length ADVISORY message can be send to clear any ADVISORY
   information on the remote side.

   N-length:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the NOTICE
      payload field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0 to
      128 inclusive.  When the length value is zero, no NOTICE payload
      field follows.

   N-duration:  This 24-bit field represents the duration in seconds for
      which the NOTICE is valid.  When the NOTICE length value is zero,
      this field is set to zero on transmission and ignored on receipt.

   N-payload:  UTF-8, up to 128 octets.

   A-length:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the next ADVISE
      key field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0 to 32
      inclusive.

   A-key:  ADVISE key, UTF-8, up to 32 octets.

   A-length:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the following
      ADVISE value field for this key, in octets.  The length value MUST
      range from 0 to 32 inclusive.

   A-value:  ADVISE value for this key, UTF-8, up to 128 octets.

   Each ADVISORY message contains zero or more NOTICE payloads.  Up to
   16 ADVISE key-value pairs can be encoded in the ADVISORY message.

2.2.1.  Note on UTF-8

   To support international characters, fields MUST be encoded using
   UTF-8.  A receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8
   sequences.  Note that when a field contains multibyte characters, the
   number of characters will be less than the length value.  Fields
   containing UTF-8 are not NUL terminated.

3.  Operational Considerations

3.1.  CLI / UI Mock-up - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section is not meant to drive UI design decisions, but rather as
   scaffold to further discussion.

4.  Error Handling

   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code: "ADVISORY
   Message Error".  The following new error subcode is defined as well:
   "Invalid Message Length".

   The error handling specified in this section is applicable only when
   a BGP speaker has received the "Support for ADVISORY Message
   Capability" from a peer.

   All errors detected while processing the ADVISORY message MUST be
   indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   ADVISORY Message Error.  The error subcode elaborates on the specific
   nature of the error.

   A zero-length ADVISORY message MUST NOT be considered malformed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD1 (ADVISORY) in the "BGP Message
   Types" subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD2 (ADVISORY Message Error) in
   the "BGP Error (Notification) Codes" subregistry under the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "ADVISORY Message Error
   subcodes" for error subcodes, under the "BGP Error Subcodes"
   subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters"
   registry.  The Registration Procedure for this new registry is "First
   Come First Served".  IANA is requested to assign value TBD3 (Invalid
   Message Length) in this new error subcode registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD4 (Support for ADVISORY Message
   Capability) in the "Capability Codes" registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the ADVISORY message.  Look at
   the security section here [I-D.ietf-idr-shutdown].  UNICODE TR36
   [UTR36] is important.
